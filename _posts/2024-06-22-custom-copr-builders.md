title: "Need something extra? Employ your own Copr builders!"

Each Copr deployment needs to [manage][resalloc] a farm of builders (normally
virtual machines) across various clouds, with various architectures and
performance profiles.

For example, in the [Fedora Copr instance][fedora-copr], where there is normally
a reasonable amount of `x86_64/amd64` builders, users very often wait for
`s390x/Z` builders.

The [recent Copr contribution][per-pkg-tags] has given us option to allocate
[high-performance builders][powerful] for specific build tasks.  And as a nice
side effect, it also opened the door to providing any other **custom workers**.
And, if you don't want to wait in the queue anymore, you can also have **workers
dedicated to your team**!

What's Needed?
--------------

Copr administrators should be able to configure a new pool(s) of VMs (builders)
for you, and then make *your builds* use them.

Of course, admins will need your permission to start the machines in your name.
There's already a built-in support for working with _IBM Cloud_, _OpenStack_,
_EC2_ or _LibVirt_ (so a cloud token is needed, or SSH access to hypervisor).
Support for other clouds could be added, too â€” we'd just need a bit more help
from you (scripting and golden-image preparation).

You need to make a budget decision.  Your builders can either be booted on
demand (which may delay the build processing by 2 or 3 minutes, but it
depends...) or use the VM pre-allocation mechanism (a few builders are booted in
advance, you pay the cloud costs for them, but they are pre-prepared to take
your tasks immediately).

Then one note (similar like with the _high-performance builders_).  For the
configured builds, your cloud account (and only that) will be used for virtual
machine allocation, and it probably isn't limitless.

------------------

_Resalloc_ also allows Copr admins to configure additional pools of workers for
the general public.  This can be beneficial for interesting use-cases (platform
enablement, specific hardware needs, AI-related builds, etc.), or even just to
boost the overall Copr throughput.  If you plan to help the community this way,
or you already do, THANK YOU very much!
